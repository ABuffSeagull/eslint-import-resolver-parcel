### About

Parcel import resolution plugin for eslint-plugin-import.
This allows for [eslint/import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import)
to work with parcel's [module resolution](https://parceljs.org/module_resolution.html).

### Installation

```
npm install eslint-import-resolver-parcel -D
```

### Usage

Add this to your eslint config:

```js
settings: {
  'import/resolver': 'parcel'
}
```

### Current status

-   [x] Relative paths (`import foo from '../foo.js'`)
-   [x] Absolute paths (`import _ from 'lodash'`)
-   [x] Tilde paths (`import foo from '~/foo.js'`)
-   [x] Root paths\* (`import foo from '/foo.js'`)
-   [x] Aliasing ([parcel docs](https://parceljs.org/module_resolution.html#aliasing))
-   [ ] Glob Paths ([parcel docs](https://parceljs.org/module_resolution.html#glob-file-paths))

#### \*About Root Paths

Because root paths require knowledge of the entry points,
you must pass in the folder where the entry points are located into the config:

```js
settings: {
  'import/resolver': {
    parcel: {
      rootDir: 'src' // wherever your entrypoints are located
    }
  }
}
```

If not specified, it will assume `process.cwd()` (where `eslint` is called from, probably where the `package.json` is located).

### Extensions

If you want to automatically add extra extensions to resolve to, e.g., `test-file` resolves to `test-file.ts`, just pass in an array to the `extensions` key of the config.

```js
settings: {
  'import/resolver': {
    parcel: {
      extensions: ['.ts'] // whatever extra extensions you want to look for
    }
  }
}
```

Current default extensions are `.js` and `.jsx`.
